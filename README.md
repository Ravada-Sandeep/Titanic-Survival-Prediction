This machine learning project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using supervised classification models. The project is based on the classic [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview), which includes information about passenger demographics, ticket details, and travel class.
