# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

<img src="https://images8.alphacoders.com/405/405029.jpg">



This machine learning project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using supervised classification models. The project is based on the classic [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview), which includes information about passenger demographics, ticket details, and travel class.
Using Machine learning algorithm on the famous Titanic Disaster Dataset for Predicting the survival of the passenger

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about passengers, including:

| Column        | Description                            |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `PassengerId` | Unique identifier                      |
| `Pclass`      | Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)|
| `Name`        | Passenger name                         |
| `Sex`         | Gender                                 |
| `Age`         | Age in years                           |
| `SibSp`       | # of siblings / spouses aboard         |
| `Parch`       | # of parents / children aboard         |
| `Fare`        | Ticket fare                            |
| `Embarked`    | Port of embarkation                    |
| `Survived`    | Target (0 = No, 1 = Yes)               |
